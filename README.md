# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Here I created a CNN model for classification of 43 traffic sign classes.
I got the training accuracy as 97% and test accuracy as 90%.

To run this, first download the dataset from the link: https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
and create a pickle file of training, validation and testing images from the dataset or
you can download the pickle files directly from this link: https://tinyurl.com/traffic-signs-data

After downloading the pickle files, you can clone the file.
Then create a new folder named traffic-signs-data and add all the pickle files in the folder.

That's it, you are ready to go.
